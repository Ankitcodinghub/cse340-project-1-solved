The goal of this project is to explore strings, pointers, and memory allocation

in C and familiarize you with the platform and tools that will be used in all

programming assignments in this course. You will use a lexical analyzer that

we developed to learn about strings, linked lists and memory management in

C. You need to master these topics in order to have a much easier time in

subsequent projects.

1 Introduction

You are provided with a small lexer (lexical analyzer) that reads tokens from stan-

dard input. Your job is to write a program that reads all tokens from the input

by calling the lexer function getToken() and store some tokens in a linked list and

then print out the contents of the linked list in a specic order.

The following section describes the provided code in detail. You should read it

carefully to learn how to use it in your code.

2 Lexer API

The lexer is composed of several functions most of which are only meant to be called

by the lexer itself and only two of the functions are intended to be used in other code.

In other words, these two functions provide the application programming interface

(API) of our lexer. These functions are declared in lexer.h:

? getToken(): reads the next token from standard input and returns its type

as an int. In some cases the actual token is stored in a global variable named

token which is a null-terminated character array. The cases for which the

actual token is stored in token are: ID, NUM, IF, WHILE, DO, THEN and PRINT.

The possible values for token type returned by getToken() are dened as

macros in lexer.h. The special value ERROR signies that getToken() has

encountered an unrecognized character in the input (a lexical error) and EOF

signies the end of input stream.

1

? ungetToken(): causes the next call to getToken() to return the last token

read by the previous call to getToken(). It simply sets a ag so that next call

to getToken() would not read another token from the input but rather return

the last token. Note that it is an error to call ungetToken() before any call

to getToken().

There are 4 global variables declared in lexer.h:1

? ttype: when getToken() is called, the token type is stored as an integer in

the variable ttype.

? token: when getToken() is called, the token value is stored in the array token.

If the token is one of ID, NUM, IF, WHILE, DO, THEN or PRINT, the variable token

contains the token string. For other token types, the variable token contains

the empty string.

? tokenLength: the length of the string stored in token

? line: the current line number of the input

3 Requirements

Your program should use the provided lexer and read all tokens from the input by

repeatedly calling the getToken() function. Some of the token strings should be

stored in a linked list. Specically, if

? The token is of type NUM, or

? The token is of type ID and the actual token is equal to one of the following

values: ‚Äúcse340‚Äù, ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù, or ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù

the token string and some other information need to be stored in a node of a linked

list. The information that needs to be stored about each of these tokens in the linked

list is the following:

? Token type (copied from ttype)

? Token value (copied from token)

? Line number in the input where token was read (copied from line)

After reading all tokens from the input and storing information about tokens

that match the above criteria, your program should go over the linked list and print

the information in reverse order with the following format for each node of the

linked list printed in a separate line:

1These variables are declared as extern variables which enables code in other les that #include

lexer.h to see these variables. The actual variables are declared in lexer.c.

2

&lt;line&gt; &lt;ttype_str&gt; &lt;token&gt;

Note that &lt;ttype str&gt; is the textual representation of the token type. The possible

values are ID and NUM.

Your submissions will be inspected by the TA to give you feedback on potential

errors in your code. You are required to store the above information in a linked list

(either single or double linked list). The nodes in the linked list should be allocated

on the heap (using malloc or other similar functions like calloc) and the allocated

memory should be freed after printing the output.

3.1 Example

Here is an example input with 4 lines:

cse340 &lt; &lt; + 123 *

456 programming

‚Äì cse 340 , LANGUAGE 100

. ; WHILE 200 IF

And here is the expected output:

4 NUM 200

3 NUM 100

3 NUM 340

2 ID programming

2 NUM 456

1 NUM 123

1 ID cse340

4 Grading

An important part of this project is to make sure that you implement the require-

ments in the manner specied. We will make sure that the output is correct, but

we will also check to make sure that you implemented a linked list, allocated space

correctly, manipulated strings correctly and so on. If the implementation does not

follow the requirements, you will not get full credit for your work.

The course website which should be used to submit your programs, has a number

of test cases for this project as well as future projects. Make sure your code passes

all test cases. The course website is only accessible from inside the ASU network,

3

so you should either be on campus or connect to ASU network via VPN software

in order to access the website. The URL for accessing the website will be

published on Blackboard.

5 Submission

1. Only C or C++ can be used for this project

2. You should submit your code on the course website by 11:59:59 pm on due

date. The website link will be posted on Blackboard

3. Read the provided code carefully, you need to fully understand it since it is

required for this project and it is used in future projects

4. There are compiling instructions in the comments written at the end of lexer.c

5. Make sure your submission has no compile problems. If you get a compile

error on the website, x the problem and submit again

6. You can submit any number of times you need, but remember that we only

grade your last submission

7. Write your code in a separate le, include lexer.h in your code to be able to

use lexer functions

8. Don‚Äôt submit the provided code, only submit the code that you write. lexer.h

and lexer.c will be added to your submission automatically on the server

9. Don‚Äôt include test scripts or test cases with your submission

10. Don‚Äôt use any whitespace characters in le names
